  StoryText: "2. You unlock the occult cupboard and peer inside. There are lots of
    old books in there, including a tattered volume entitled \"Unaussprechlichen Kulten\"
    by Friedrich von Junzt and some loose pages bound with twine which you recognise
    as the fragmentary \"Book of Eibon\". In pride of place, however, is a leather-bound
    grimoire held shut with large metal clasps... the dreaded Necronomicon by the
    nad arab, Abdul Alhazred!\r\n\r\n1. Do you heed your nagging fear and hurry back
    to the front desk...\r\n\r\n2. or will you have a quick glance at the Necronomicon?\r"
