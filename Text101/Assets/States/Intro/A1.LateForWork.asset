  StoryText: "1. You arrive late! Your new boss, Mr. Catchpole, is clearly annoyed
    but has no time to reprimand you as he's suddenly needed on the other side of
    campus. He quickly tells you not to leave the front desk for any reason whatsoever,
    and not to lose the key to the occult books cupboard.\r\n\r\n1. Make yourself
    comfortable at the desk...\r\n\r\n2. ...or take a look in the occult books cupboard."
