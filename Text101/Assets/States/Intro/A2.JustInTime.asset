  StoryText: "2. You arrive at the library five minutes early to find your new boss,
    Mr. Catchpole, feeding the library's guard-dog in the vestibule. Following him
    inside, he swiftly shows you around and tells you that on no account are you to
    leave the front desk unattended, and then he goes on to explain the library's
    unique filing system.\r\n\r\n1. Pay close attention and make notes.\r\n\r\n2.
    Don't worry too much, it's your first day"
