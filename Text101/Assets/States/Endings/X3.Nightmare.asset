  StoryText: "1. You check the book out swiftly and efficiently, and the man congratulates
    you on your professionalism. \n\nFeeling proud of yourself, when Mr. Cattermole
    returns you tell him that you gave the gentleman the Necronomicon as he instructed.
    Cattermole's face goes pale and then he cackles dementedly. He didn't stop laughing
    even when the people from the sanitarium came and took him away. \n\nAnd now,
    one week later as you run screaming from the ravaging, roaring Nightgaunts that
    are tearing up the town, you understand why Cattermole chose madness over this
    terrible fate...\n1.FINISH"
