  StoryText: "1. The stranger shoots you a look of pure malevolence and you watch
    as he lurches off out of the library looking fearful and desperate, his bodily
    frame somehow bulging under his ever-tightening frock-coat.\nMr. Catchpole returns
    and as you tell him about your encounter you both hear a distant explosion. It's
    only later when you overhear Dr. Halsey and Prof. Atwood discussing the theory
    of spontaneous human combustion that you realize that it must have been the stranger
    who spontaneously combusted... \nThankfully, the rest of the afternoon passes
    uneventfully. As you walk home through the pale mist, you wonder if maybe just
    maybe - you saved the world from horrors beyond imagination on your very first
    day as assistant librarian. Either way, Mr. Catchpole expects you back tomorrow...
    and tomorrow's another day\n1.FINISH"
